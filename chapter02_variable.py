# this is to learn what 'variable' is. 

#i did the followings in termial with a python shell. so this is what a alist is
#a = 15 
#print (a)
#a = [1, 2, 3, 4]
#a [2]
#type (a) - to show a is a int 
#10 ==10 is to ask if 10 equals to 10, so it will return 'true"
#10 != 11 is asking if 11 equals to 10 and of course it will print false
# python does not let us mix between strings and integers. so we can convert interger into a string by typing 'str(1)' and 1 is now a string 
# lists work as well. 
# questions above works for strings too
